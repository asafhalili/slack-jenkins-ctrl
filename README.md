# Slack Jenkins Ctrl
A Slack bot to control Jenkins easily & quickly.

## Intro
This jenkins controller built to improve the productivity of jenkins users.<br />
Meaning, the vision is to allow control any feature of jenkins via slack.
However, there is still a lot to do regarding that and the bot is far from done.

## Usage
Currently, all the features are messages-based (instead of slack commands based).

- find
- run/build
- jobs
- queue
- enable
- disable
